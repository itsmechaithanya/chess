# Chessboard Movement Visualization

This project visualizes the possible movements of a bishop (camel) in chess using a React application styled with Tailwind CSS. By clicking on any cell, you can see all the diagonally aligned cells that a bishop can reach from that position.

## Features

- **Interactive Chessboard**: Click on any cell to highlight the diagonal cells that a bishop can move to.
- **Undo Functionality**: Revert the chessboard to its previous state before the last move.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
